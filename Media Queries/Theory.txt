---> We have phones having device width of let's say : 480px.
     Similarly, we have tablets having device width of let's say : 680px.
     We have laptops having device width of let's say : 980px.
     and, we have Big monitors having device width of let's say : > 1000px.

So, user can open a particular application in the phone , tab , laptops and on some big screen.
So, our content of that website should be responsive to that screen.

It should automatically align or resize according to the screen.


---> Media queries helps us to create responsive designs.

Note : 

1.  To write the Media query we have to write '@media' first.

2.  Now, give the type of the media query.
     
    And we can give the type of media query. If give 'All' then it will run for all the devices.
    If we write type : Screen ---> Then intended primarily for screens (mobile , laptops , bigscreens etc).
    If we write type : print then it will work for printing machines.

     @media screen

3. After that we can give some conditions. Like:
   
   @media and (width:790px){

    h1,p{

        color : red;
    }

   }

   i.e when the width of the screen becomes 790px then you have to make the heading and paragraph color as red. 



---------------------------------------- Orientation --------------------------------------------------

---> Hamaare device kii do tarah se orientation ho sakti hain :

 1. Portrait
 2. Landscape


 Kuch device kii orientation change karne se bhi unke content par asar padtaa hain.
 And this can also be handle by the media query.


 Note : When ---> (Width > Height) then orientation is Landscape.
        and When ---> (Height > Width) then orientation is Portrait.
